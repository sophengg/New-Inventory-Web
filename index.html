                    THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER Many famed music producers are
                    known for a particular sound that has its day and then ages
                    out. Rick Rubin is known for something else: creating a
                    space where artists of all different genres and traditions
                    can home in on who they really are and what they really
                    offer. He has made a practice of helping people transcend
                    their self-imposed expectations in order to reconnect with a
                    state of innocence from which the surprising becomes
                    inevitable. Over the years, as he has thought deeply about
                    where creativity comes from and where it doesnt, he has
                    learned that being an artist isnt about your specific
                    output; its about your relationship to the world. Creativity
                    has a place in everyones life, and everyone can make that
                    place larger. In fact, there are few more important
                    responsibilities. The Creative Act is a beautiful and
                    generous course of study that illuminates the path of the
                    artist as a road we all can follow. It distils the wisdom
                    gleaned from a lifetimes work into a luminous reading
                    experience that puts the power to create moments and
                    lifetimes of exhilaration and transcendence within closer
                    reach for all of us.

                    Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the
                    Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and
                    history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her
                    tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the
                    hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of
                    Navarre: dragon riders. But when youre smaller than everyone
                    else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat
                    away...because dragons dont bond to “fragile” humans. They
                    incinerate them. With fewer dragons willing to bond than
                    cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances
                    of success. The rest would kill her just for being her
                    mothers daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and
                    ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant. Shell need every
                    edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.
                    Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more
                    deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the
                    death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to
                    suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret. Friends,
                    enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an
                    agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out:
                    graduate or die.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    In this New York Times bestselling investigation, Ted Koppel
                    reveals that a major cyberattack on America's power grid is
                    not only possible but likely, that it would be devastating,
                    and that the United States is shockingly unprepared. Imagine
                    a blackout lasting not days, but weeks or months. Tens of
                    millions of people over several states are affected. For
                    those without access to a generator, there is no running
                    water, no sewage, no refrigeration or light. Food and
                    medical supplies are dwindling. Devices we rely on have gone
                    dark. Banks no longer function, looting is widespread, and
                    law and order are being tested as never before. It isn't
                    just a scenario. A well-designed attack on just one of the
                    nation's three electric power grids could cripple much of
                    our infrastructure--and in the age of cyberwarfare, a laptop
                    has become the only necessary weapon. Several nations
                    hostile to the United States could launch such an assault at
                    any time. In fact, as a former chief scientist of the NSA
                    reveals, China and Russia have already penetrated the grid.
                    And a cybersecurity advisor to President Obama believes that
                    independent actors--from "hacktivists" to terrorists--have
                    the capability as well. "It's not a question of if," says
                    Centcom Commander General Lloyd Austin, "it's a question of
                    when." And yet, as Koppel makes clear, the federal
                    government, while well prepared for natural disasters, has
                    no plan for the aftermath of an attack on the power grid.
                    The current Secretary of Homeland Security suggests keeping
                    a battery-powered radio. In the absence of a government
                    plan, some individuals and communities have taken matters
                    into their own hands. Among the nation's estimated three
                    million "preppers," we meet one whose doomsday retreat
                    includes a newly excavated three-acre lake, stocked with
                    fish, and a Wyoming homesteader so self-sufficient that he
                    crafted the thousands of adobe bricks in his house by hand.
                    We also see the unrivaled disaster preparedness of the
                    Mormon church, with its enormous storehouses, high-tech
                    dairies, orchards, and proprietary trucking company - the
                    fruits of a long tradition of anticipating the worst. But
                    how, Koppel asks, will ordinary civilians survive? With
                    urgency and authority, one of our most renowned journalists
                    examines a threat unique to our time and evaluates potential
                    ways to prepare for a catastrophe that is all but
                    inevitable.

                    The #1 New York Times-bestselling author's terrifying new
                    thriller about one man's ice-cold malice, and one woman's
                    fight to reclaim her life. Former Army brat Morgan Albright
                    has finally planted roots in a friendly neighborhood near
                    Baltimore. Her friend and roommate Nina helps her make the
                    mortgage payments, as does Morgan's job as a bartender. But
                    after she and Nina host their first dinner party—attended by
                    Luke, the flirtatious IT guy who'd been chatting her up at
                    the bar—her carefully built world is shattered. The back
                    door glass is broken, cash and jewelry are missing, her car
                    is gone, and Nina lies dead on the floor. Soon, a horrific
                    truth emerges: It was Morgan who let the monster in. "Luke"
                    is actually a cold-hearted con artist named Gavin who
                    targets a particular type of woman, steals her assets and
                    identity, and then commits his ultimate goal: murder. What
                    the FBI tells Morgan is beyond chilling. Nina wasn't his
                    type. Morgan is. Nina was simply in the wrong place at the
                    wrong time. And Morgan's nightmare is just beginning. Soon
                    she has no choice but to flee to her mother's home in
                    Vermont. While she struggles to build something new, she
                    meets another man, Miles Jameson. He isn't flashy or
                    flirtatious, and his family business has deep roots in town.
                    But Gavin is still out there hunting new victims, and he
                    hasn't forgotten the one who got away.

                    Three estranged sisters reconnect in their Louisiana
                    hometown to face an unresolved past in a heartfelt novel
                    about family, grief, secrets, and forgiveness. Savannah was
                    four years old when her twin sister, Georgia, went missing
                    from their small Louisiana town, fracturing their family.
                    Twenty-eight years later, Savannah convinces her estranged
                    older sisters, Rayanne and Sue Ellen, to honor the pact they
                    made as children and retrieve the time capsule they buried
                    in their old backyard. But coming home means confronting old
                    ghosts...and their stubborn grandmother, Meemaw. Sifting
                    through the artifacts, they come across a photograph taken
                    on the day Georgia disappeared and spot a familiar woman
                    lingering in the background. While Sue Ellen and Rayanne
                    want to move on with their lives, Savannah is determined to
                    find the woman--and perhaps a clue to the past. When old
                    tensions, rivalries, and memories resurface, the sisters
                    must reconsider what they thought they knew about that
                    fateful day, about each other, and about themselves. On
                    their search to uncover what happened to Georgia, each of
                    them will discover what Meemaw has known all along: family
                    is everything.

                    From comedy writing duo Alli Frank and Asha Youmans comes
                    The Better Half, a sidesplitting spin on reaching the
                    pinnacle of life, only to stare down a slippery slope on the
                    other side. After a difficult five years, at age
                    forty-three, Nina Morgan Clarke's time has finally arrived.
                    With an ex-husband relocated across the country, her father
                    bouncing back after the loss of his beloved wife, and her
                    daughter, Xandra, thriving at boarding school, Nina is
                    stepping into her dream job as a trifecta: a
                    first-generation, Black female head of the storied
                    Royal-Hawkins School. To mark the moment, Nina and her best
                    friend, Marisol, take a long-overdue girls' trip to
                    celebrate the second half of Nina's life--which is shaping
                    up to be the best part of her life. As Nina's school year
                    gets underway, all seems to be progressing as planned.
                    Before long, wunder-hire Jared Jones, two hundred pounds of
                    Harvard-educated ego, relentlessly pushes Nina to her
                    ethical limits. Soon after, dutiful Xandra accuses one of
                    her teachers of misconduct. And most alarming, the
                    repercussions of her trip with Marisol force Nina into a
                    life-altering choice. Time is of the essence, and Nina must
                    decide if she will embrace a future she never could have
                    predicted.
